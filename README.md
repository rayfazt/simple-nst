# Neural Style Transfer
Neural style transfer is, in short, a process of combining two images with distinctively different styles to produce an image 
that resembles both styles. I tried to do this by utilizing fast style transfer on TF-Hub. To yield a better result it is preferred to build a model from scratch instead.
